// 1.React and its popularity


// React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
// It is popular in web development due to its advantages such as reusability of components, efficient rendering with the virtual DOM, a large and active community, extensive documentation, and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools


//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//


//2.Components are the building blocks of user interfaces in React.
// They are self-contained, reusable pieces of code that encapsulate their own functionality, styles, and rendering logic.
// Components can be composed together to create complex user interfaces, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
    }
}


//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//


//3. Functional components are defined as JavaScript functions that return JSX code. They are simpler, lightweight, and don't have their own internal state or lifecycle methods.
// Class components are defined as JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class. They have their own internal state and can define lifecycle methods.
// With the introduction of hooks, functional components have gained popularity and can now handle state and lifecycle methods using hooks like useState and useEffect.

function FunctionalComponent(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
    }
}


//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//


// 4. React handles state management using hooks.
// The useState hook is a built-in hook in React that allows functional components to declare and manage state variables.
// It takes an initial value as a parameter and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state.
// Developers can use destructuring assignment to assign names to these elements.
// By calling the state update function, React re-renders the component and updates the UI to reflect the new state.


//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//


//5. JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which gets transformed into plain JavaScript by a transpiler like Babel.
// JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to JavaScript used in React for writing component templates.
// It allows developers to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code.
// JSX combines the power of JavaScript with the expressiveness of HTML, making it easier to write and understand component templates.
// It allows embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces {} to dynamically generate content and manipulate data within the component template.
const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;


//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//


//6. Data can be passed from a parent component to a child component in React using props.
// When rendering the child component within the parent component's JSX code, you can specify attributes on the child component's JSX tag to pass data.
// The child component can access the passed data through the props object.


//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//


//7. What are React props and how are they used to pass data between components?

// React props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to its child components.
// Props are specified as attributes on the JSX tag of the child component when it is rendered by the parent component.
// The child component can access and use the received props to render appropriate content or perform specific actions.


//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//


//8. Describe the React lifecycle methods and their significance.


// React lifecycle methods are methods that are called at different stages of a component's life cycle.
// They allow developers to perform certain actions or respond to events during the various stages of a component's existence.
// Some common lifecycle methods in class components are componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
// However, with the introduction of hooks, the use of lifecycle methods in functional components has been largely replaced by the useEffect hook.


//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//


//9 What is the purpose of keys in React lists? Why are they important?


// Keys in React lists are special attributes used to identify each item in a list of elements.
// They help React efficiently update the DOM when the list changes by identifying which items have changed, been added, or been removed.
// Keys help optimize the rendering process, minimize unnecessary DOM manipulations, and maintain component state correctly when the list is updated.


//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//




// 10. Explain the concept of conditional rendering in React.

// Conditional rendering in React refers to the ability to conditionally render different parts of the user interface based on certain conditions.
// It allows showing or hiding components, changing their content, or applying different styles depending on the current state or props of the component.
// Conditional rendering can be achieved using JavaScript expressions within JSX code, such as if statements, ternary operators, and logical operators like && and ||.




//11.  Writing React without JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used by React to define components and their structure. However, it is possible to write React components without JSX using the React.createElement function. Here's an example:
const App = () => {
  return React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello, World!');
};




//12 . Babel: Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write modern JavaScript code and transpile it into backward-compatible versions that can run in older browsers. It helps ensure cross-browser compatibility by transforming newer syntax and features into widely supported code. Babel can be configured using a file named .babelrc or specified in the babel.config.js file





//13. Webpack: Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies and generates optimized bundles that can be served to the browser. Webpack handles assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images, and allows developers to use various loaders and plugins to process and optimize different types of files. It helps with tasks like code splitting, minification, and transpilation. Webpack configuration is typically defined in a file named webpack.config.js




//14. Lazy Loading: Lazy loading is a technique used in web development to defer the loading of certain resources (e.g., components, modules, or data) until they are needed. It helps improve performance by reducing the initial load time and only fetching or rendering the necessary content when required. In React, lazy loading can be achieved using the React.lazy function and the Suspense component. Here's an example:
const App1 = () => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
};




//15. Thunks: Thunks are a type of middleware in Redux that allows the dispatching of functions as actions. This is useful for handling asynchronous operations, such as API calls, where multiple actions may need to be dispatched during the process. Redux Thunk provides a way to write action creators that return functions instead of plain action objects. Thunks can be used to delay the dispatch of an action or dispatch multiple actions based on certain conditions.

const fetchUser = createAsyncThunk('user/fetchUser', async (userId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
});



//16. Combine Reducers: combineReducers is a helper function provided by Redux to combine multiple reducers into a single root reducer. It takes an object as input, where each key-value pair represents a specific reducer function. This helps in modularizing and organizing the state management when different parts of the application have their own reducers. Here's an example:
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterReducer,
  user: userReducer,
});




//17. Side effects: Side effects in Redux refer to any external interactions or asynchronous operations that occur during the state update process. Examples of side effects include making API calls, interacting with a database, or dispatching additional actions. Redux middleware, such as Redux Thunk or Redux Saga, can be used to handle side effects in a controlled and organized manner.
